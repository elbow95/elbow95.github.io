      I am currently a 4nd year university student in <i>Ludong university</i>.
      The time of last three years I majored in <i>Electrical Engineering and Automation</i>,
      I am good at C language programming and ARM embedded programming, and I love Android, ios, Linux and all geek things.<br/><br/>
      I am a big fan of <i>Google</i>, <i>Microsoft</i>, <i>Apple</i>, <i>Linux</i>, <i>NASA</i> and <i>SpaceX</i>.
      In my free time I write blogs, read books and watch movies.
      "<i>The Legend of 1900</i>" is my favorite movie. And <i>C</i> is my favorite programming language.<br/><br/>
      I love traveling and I always take a lot of photos to record the beautiful scenes. I use this personal blog to record learning, life and other things since Mar 2016.<br/><br/>

      I am Zhang Zhen(<i>Clarence</i>), currently a 4nd year university student in <i>Ludong university</i>.
      I am also a determined patriotic independent. <br/><br/>
      The time of last three years I majored in <i>Electrical Engineering and Automation</i>,
      I am good at C language programming, and I love C#, ARM embedded system, Android and all geek things.<br/><br/>
      I am a big fan of <i>Google</i>, <i>Microsoft</i>, <i>Apple</i>, <i>Linux</i>, <i>NASA</i> and science.
      In my free time I write blogs, read books and watch movies.
      "<i>The Legend of 1900</i>" is my favorite movie. And <i>C</i> is my favorite programming language all the time.<br/><br/>
      I use this personal blog to record learning, life and other things since Mar 2016.<br/><br/>

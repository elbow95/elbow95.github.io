I"u<p>It should be the first essay after built up this blog.</p>

<p>I want to start a new beginning by this post without Chinese, there will be more and more essay about life or technology in English. Although I can’t use ornate rhetoric to describe something. But I think it is indeed a improvement for me that I can write a whole essay in English.</p>

<p>Chinese students always say “My English is very pool”, though we already have remembered as much words as we can talk to a foreigner, but you know it is not about the number of words we have remembered, it’s about culture.</p>

<p>In my word, it is not possible we can say English as a foreigner if we don’t have an experience to live in an English-speaking country.</p>

<p><strong>But the most advanced technology always be published by an English paper</strong> :(</p>

<p>I have a long time studied in the Smartcar Lab, I am very grateful for this place and the instructor. In that two years I have learned much about the embedded system and I’m addicted to it. But I always think the most useful skill I have mastered is I can read a data sheet or a user manual by myself.</p>

<p>Now, in this dormitory, one guy playing game, the other two are listening Feng Timo who singing in a live streaming platform named Douyu TV, her voice is very clear and beautiful. A great girl.</p>

<p>It’s time to call with my darling.</p>
